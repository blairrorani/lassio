> “Thanks to our teams using Lassio Rhythm and the notifications built in&mdash;we were able to pickup on and prevent several frontline workers from attending some work sites. It’s these types of pro-active services that will help our Compliance teams better deal with Covid cases and the uncertain environment we currently live in”
