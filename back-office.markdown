<h2>Workbench ai</h2>
### Overview
Processing scanned, PDF and other images for validation and extraction of data is tedious and inefficient best. Attachments need to be opened, viewed  and re-keyed resulting in expensive error prone activities. Workbench uses digital vision and ai to read documents, receipts, statements and contacts and extracts everything from these documents for easy validation or transposing into systems or processes. It can even read handwriting.

Workbench also has an Assisted Automation option or “human in the loop” for exception management and validation if required. This simplifies the management of any edge cases and increases the efficiency and productivity of anyone required to undertake this.

Workbench also has the ability to reduce fraud by detecting duplicates and other “signals of interest” ( eg have we seen this document or invoice number before ).

### Recent Examples of successful projects
- Trading Report Extraction, Consolidation and Compliance using ai
- Invoice Submissions Validation with SalesForce Integration
- Shipping Document and Sales Contract Extraction and Data
- Consolidation for onward shipping

## Full Lifecycle Automation Managed Services (LAMS)
### Overview
Most organisations are attracted to automation because it removes relative, high volume manual work. This frees people up and allows them to focus on the things that matter most - like solving problems and adding value in ways that are uniquely human eg customer care. The problem however is that purchasing, configuring, deploying, operating and managing automation requires specialist skill sets. These are usually formed around automation projects in large organisations who can afford these skill sets and can afford to operate a centre of excellence for ongoing operation.  Medium and smaller sized organisations can now access the same capabilities and purchase these outcomes as a subscription service allowing them to get all the benefits of automation - without any of the distractions. Lassio will design, deliver, operate and manage automations as a service with full service level agreements (SLA’s).

- Business Process Automation and Validation for Loan Approval Systems using Robotic Process Automation and API integration.     
- HR Onboarding Automation, Data Consolidation and Compliance Reporting
- Supervisory Check-In solutions for Front line workers, Team Leaders and Managers

## Continual Compliance Services (CCS)
### Overview
The burden of compliance and the complexity of all the multitude of systems and that manage it in different ways is a headache for many organisations. The continual compliance service uses digital workers (bots) to compile reports, extract information from email, directories, various systems, compile and then consolidate and send reminders and alerts when required. Our goal is to create audit ready services where 7x24x365 checking of all the data and actions across any number of systems and processes occurs. This situational awareness of your current exposure and posture allows you to have confidence that you’re not placing directors or the organisation at risk. When it's time for audit you won't have to divert staff from their normal jobs to spend months preparing
