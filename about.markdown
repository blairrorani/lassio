title: About Lassio
---

Lassio was founded by a small group of professionals who thought there had to be a better way to digitally transform organisations. At the heart of it we understand the profound changes that the future of work will bring.

We started with some big goals.
 ​
- How do we provide capabilities as a service that can scale?
- How do we make it cost effective with a phenomenal ROI?
- How can we empower business units while leveraging the existing IT infrastructure and services in a non-intrusive and non-disruptive way?
- Could we become the largest sovereign wholesale outsourcer of digital tasks in Australia using state of the art technology and AI?
- How can we remove tedious and repetitive tasks from those that have to work across multiple systems and data silos?
- If we could improve this; how can we create efficiencies so that humans can focus on higher value tasks?

We approached the problem with no technical debt, no legacy baggage and no preconceptions. We used our extensive experience to develop practical managed service products that make it easy and repeatable to apply automation for any organisation&mdash;improving staff satisfaction and cost to serve.
 ​
We feel like we've only just started and want to make sure that as we grow we remain true to our original vision.
