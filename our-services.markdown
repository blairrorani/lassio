Lassio is a digital product business but we prefer to think of our products in context of the problems they solve in the new era of work. Wherever possible we deliver as a service to our customers so that they don't have to concern themselves with configuring, owning, operating and managing technology.  Managed services delivered with service level agreements that produce outcomes without the complexity.
